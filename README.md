How to use.
Where it says "birth date:" type your birth date in.

e.g: If your birth date is 4th january, 1994, type in 4/1/94 (the 4th day of the 1st month, in the year '94)
it will find your birth date (seen by the program as 4194, in this case) in pi.

If your birthdate is not found in pi, don't feel bad. There is only 3,014,654 digits stored within tink.
